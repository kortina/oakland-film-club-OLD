I've been following Kevin B. Lee for a few years (ever since I saw his film essay on Out 1). He talks a lot about a genre he calls "desktop film" [https://www.alsolikelife.com/home/desktop-films](https://www.alsolikelife.com/home/desktop-films) and I thought it would be cool to do a few things in this vein.

I think it will make for a fun change of pace. Plus, with a bunch of youtube-direct picks, maybe we'll inspire John to join us!

All of these are really excellent, so I hope you see them even if you don't join for the discussion.
